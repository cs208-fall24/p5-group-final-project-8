## Experience
This experience is a mixed bag, yet the best part of it is the team.
<br />Teammates made it easy to collaborate, and I like how everyone tried their best to find a time that worked for everyone for the meetups and the standup meetings.
<br />
Then, check in with one another and see how the work is progressing. I appreciate that, as I hate group work.
<br />
Because I always had terrible groups to work with in the past, which left a bad taste in my mouth, however, I will say this is an experience heading in the proper and positive direction. 
<br />
In terms of working on the project itself, it hurt that I still needed to finish Project 4, so I was not familiar with PUG and how it worked, which was annoying to some extent. Also, regarding the code itself, I needed clarification about whether I should go all in or make something simple. The class is not a design class, and I'm aware of this fact, but that was something on my mind that I was thinking about as I was trying to finish the project.
<br />
Also, my local host 3000 was not working at all, so I either had to work mindlessly or work somewhere else and then transfer everything back to the repository, which meant I could not see what my other tames ended up making. I wouldn't say I liked that; however, at the time of writing, I plan to see everything they made when we get to the showcasing part, which I will help organize, so this would be a great chance to see what my teammates made during this time. 


## Known issues or Bugs
Regarding the issues I had, it was with both merging and how hectic that can be, but overall, the team handled that well. Granted, I still struggle with it. 
<br />
Also, my local host 3000 did not work, no matter what I tried, and I started the project without having that to work. I just found some workarounds to complete the work, as we have deadlines. My team was waiting for my updates, so I needed to do something before I sat and waited. I had to find some workaround to get all that done, and it was simply by working outside getting everything done in an HTML, then transferring that and translating that to a PUG, and then plugging it with CSS as well.
