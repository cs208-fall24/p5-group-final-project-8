## Experience
This experience is a has been fun, but it gave a good idea about what I do not want to do as a job for the rest of my life, and in terms of the best part of it was the team that I end up working with, as they made it easy to collaborate. I like how everyone tried their best to find a time that worked for everyone for the meetups and the standup meetings.

In order to check in with one another and see how the work is progressing. I appreciate that, as I hate group work; because I always had terrible groups in terms of group projects to work with in the past, where I end up doing everything myself, which left a bad taste in my mouth. However, I will say this is an experience heading in the proper and positive direction.

In terms of working on the project itself, it hurt that I still need to finish Project 4 and learn about PUG from that project, which meant for this project I was not familiar with PUG and how it worked. That was annoying to some extent.

Also, regarding the code itself, I needed to decide for myself about whether I should go all in or make something simple, and I'm aware that this is not a design class; Yet, that was something on my mind as I was working on this project, since it is a balancing act between time and how creative do you want to be with your project?

Furthermore; my local host 3000 was not working at all. Which meant I either had to work while being blind in terms of what I'm creating or work somewhere else and then transfer everything back to the repository at the end, yet, after a lot of troubleshooting, it turns out that someone modifed the server.js file, and missed up everything, so I had to fix that myself, and inform my group about it as well. 

Now, I must say, that was the most fun part, which is trouble shooting and trying to figure out why the server is not working, and then when i figured that out, I had that rush of blood that I like, and it is why I'm doing programing in the first place!

Before getting the local host to work, I just found some workarounds to complete the work, as we have deadlines, and my team was waiting for my updates, so I needed to do something before the deadline appraoches, instead of setting and waiting. The simple solution was by working outside on HTML and CSS and such, then getting everything transferred to my repo, after translating what needs to be translated to PUG, and then plugging it with CSS and JavaScript at the end, which was fun as well.

All and all, it was great, but I know now that I will never work in the web develoment section / industry, as it is not my cup of tea, since I would rather do memory management and embedded systems using C instead, or trying to overclock hardawre for it to give me extra 5% of an imaginary number.
