## Experience

Getting experience with using a git repository for a project was an unique and enjoyed experience. Overall everything in this project I was able to complete without too many issues. My first struggle came when I was attempting to allow users to edit their comments, as this was the first time I've had to use the UPDATE feature for sqlite3. I also was confused at first on the dynamic of the team project, but I've got it all understood now. I also had some trouble trying to add a feature that shows how long ago a comment was made, but with some research I was able to resolve this using the JULIANDAY function. For the most part all of the html, css, and js work was just review from previous modules and projects so I didn't have too many problems. I really enjoy these kind of projects that put all our concepts together and it was very satisfying creating my webpage and being able to add cool features like the timestamps on the comments. As far as the team aspect that was a little more challenging, our team decided on communication through discord, which was fine for me, and we were able to get a chat with all of us set up pretty quickly. The real issue came with trying to schedule times to meet, both my teammates seem to have busy schedules which is completely understandable, it just made it difficult to find times that we all could meet. We also were all on very different levels of progress, and I believe I will be the only merging my work on the "merging madness" day, so hopefully they are able to merge their work okay after me. To conclude my experience with this project was enjoyed, I think it is really cool adding functionality to my website with javascript, and I enjoyed the creativity from creating my own major and styling with CSS, the team aspect was new and challenging but I appreciate the chance to get real experience with team repositories.
