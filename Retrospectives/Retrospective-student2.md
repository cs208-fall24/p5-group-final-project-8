## Experience

This project was fun but difficult. I’m used to solving physical, hands-on problems, so sitting down and tackling something like building a website was definitely a challenge. It was pretty satisfying to see everything come together, almost like finishing a house—it just happens to be digital.

The hardest part for me was getting used to the syntax and tools. Learning how to structure the CSS and make everything look decent was kind of like laying out a set of building plans: you’ve got to think ahead and make sure all the pieces work together. The most rewarding part, though, was getting the comment section to work. When I saw that first comment appear on the page, I felt like I’d just hung the last cabinet in a kitchen remodel—super satisfying.

One thing that stood out to me is how similar this is to managing a team on a job site. There’s communication, planning, and making sure everyone’s work fits together in the end. I guess construction and coding have more in common than I thought!

## Known issues or Bugs

At first, the comments weren’t showing up on the page. Turned out, I wasn’t querying the database correctly. Once I figured that out, it worked like a charm.
Responsiveness on mobile was tricky. Some elements didn’t line up right at smaller screen sizes until I added a few media queries. It’s all good now, though.

My biggest issue is with Node.js my computer is taking a ridiculous amount of time to start the server. I have tried to fix it but I have not been able to do so.
