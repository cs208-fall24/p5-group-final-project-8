        h3 Introduction To Anime Major
        p Anime isn't a major just anyone could enroll in, you need to be super into Anime, and knows what the Anime Clymore is for example, and have put many many many hours and time into watching anime, and understand why watching Anime in dubs is a big sin, for you to have a chance to enroll and be a part of our major, as it is quite competitive. You need many hours of hard work of setting in front of your laptop or phone, and watch Anime for hours! And this might seem daunting at first, but it is worth it, trust us!
